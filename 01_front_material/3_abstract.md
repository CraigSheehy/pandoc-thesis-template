\chapter{Abstract}

This project spearheads the problems of poor human driving habits by building software that tracks the users' position on the road, identifying the lane lines and accurately track them and plot indicative lines for the user to follow. 

The problem with this project was how to build a software that could seamlessly work in tandem with a user operating a car and not interact with the user's steering wheel but to recommend correction suggestions, that would alert them to alter their position on the road. 

Independent research and analysis were gathered on the best ways to develop an effective approach to tackle this specific problem using the most efficient methods to gather and process such huge amounts of data. 

Key features in the development of this project include heavy use of 'Unity Game Engine' as scenes were specifically created by the user as test scenarios for the project on how well it would perform. 

The result is a simple way a car in theory drives itself along the road.

# Chapter 3 : Literature Review
## Introduction 

The topic that I will be researching into is Lane Assistant Technologies and developments around that area of research, how people in the past have implemented methods of adding lane assist to their vehicles. This review will be based upon past papers about advancing technologies in this sector. The reason for writing this review is to get a better personal understanding about the current available understanding about the available technologies and how they were built and identifying current problems in the current technology that could be potentially phased out with future builds of the technology and how it could be improved upon.  

## Main Research Questions
- What is OpenCV and what can it do? 
- What are the current limitations faced? 
- Can this technology be fitted to every vehicle? 
- Will complex shadows hinder the technology?

### What is OpenCV and what can it do?

OpenCV is a library filled of programming functions that are aim at this idea of real-time computer vision, originally developed by Intel in June of the year 1999 and later to be supported by a robotics company Willow Garage and then Itseez, which was then acquired by Intel. 
With the ability to solve small computer problems like “ray tracing” which is a method to accurately depict shadows and reflections from the real world and replicate them into a digital world, the uses for OpenCV became endless. The goal which was set by Intel back in 1999 was to create a software that contained critical optimized code which was portable the user which they hoped which would be free to use as the project was “Open Source” which meant anyone who wanted to add to the project could.
